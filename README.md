# Hawaii Alert UI
An exercise for web design / UX students using a mockup of Hawaii's Emergency Alert user interface.

## Background

In January 2018, [Hawaiians mistakenly received an alert on their cell phones warning of an incoming ballistic missile](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/business/hawaii-missile-emergency-alert.html). The source of the false alarm was reported to be a misclick of a link on a [screen capable of sending out both real and test alerts](https://twitter.com/CivilBeat/status/953127914618302464).

## Assignment

Your assignment is to design and build an alternative UI for sending alerts. Start with pencil and paper, identifying the responsibilities of the UI and considering how best to organize the information it contains. Then, using the [provided HTML](https://sambrenner.github.io/hawaii-alert-demo/), build your UI. You may edit the HTML and write CSS to realize your design.
